## Community

Communities represent the culture or environment your character grew up in. Though a character might have been a member of numerous communities during their upbringing, this choice represents the one they feel had the most influence over their personality and current skill set.

As with ancestries, describing the characteristics of a collective is nuanced, as people always view others through the lens of their own experience. For example, while a seaborne sailor might feel their own community is particularly strict, a character from an orderborne metropolis might find that group very changeable. An individual’s relationship with their community also creates a wide variety of experiences. If your character has fallen out with the people that defined their upbringing, they might continue to carry that influence but also strive to live differently than they were taught.

As you explore the communities in this section, imagine the variety of ways they might manifest in your game. Some community cards reference locations, others an ethos, and others a common goal, but no two places that fall under the same category are identical. If one wanderborne caravan travels the world willingly and another was expelled from their home by force, each community’s material trappings and their people’s feelings about their lifestyle would be very different.

When you build your character, you can draw inspiration from communities other than the one you’ve chosen. As always, this aspect of the game is meant to be utilized in the way that best serves your group.

Each community has a **community feature** granted to your character by their community that can be utilized in play.

_**Tip:** Each community entry suggests six adjectives that you can use as inspiration when crafting a character. If you’d like, choose one or more of these words (or roll a d6) to help develop your character’s personality, their relationship with their upbringing or peers, or even the demeanor with which they interact with the rest of their party._
