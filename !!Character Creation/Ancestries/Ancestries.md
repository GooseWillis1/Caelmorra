## Ancestry

Ancestries represent your character’s lineage, which affects their physical appearance. The following section describes each ancestry in Daggerheart and the physical characteristics shared by members of that ancestry. That said, you can decide that your character possesses characteristics that aren’t “standard” or “average” for that ancestry. We encourage you to look to the art for inspiration and explore the diversity within individual ancestries as you craft your character’s appearance.

We hope this section provides a window into the various physicalities of the creatures that populate Daggerheart. As you play and meet members of each ancestry, you’ll have the opportunity to learn about the nuances and unique qualities among them. You’ll also notice that within the world of Daggerheart, the term “people” is used to refer to all ancestries, as individuals from all lineages possess unique characteristics and cultures, as well as personhood.

Some ancestries are described using the term “humanoid.” This does not refer to that specific ancestry having any relation to “humans,” the distinct ancestry within Daggerheart. Specifically, it refers to the set of physical characteristics readers will recognize from their own anatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright posture, facial layout, and more. These traits vary by ancestry and individual, though “humanoid” should still provide a useful frame of reference.

Each ancestry has two **ancestry features**. While some features (such as the ability to fly) are directly tied to an ancestry’s anatomy, you ultimately get to determine your character’s physical form. If you decide that your faerie character never had wings or lost theirs, you can work with the GM to replace the “Wings” feature that grants faeries flight. It’s likewise up to you to decide how important your character’s appearance is to their story.


## Mixed Ancestry

Families within the world of Daggerheart are as unique as the peoples and cultures that inhabit it. Anyone’s appearance and skill set can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety of other factors.

If you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple ancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the game, use the steps below:

### **Step 1: Determine Ancestry Combination**

When you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down how your character identifies themself in the Heritage section of your character sheet. For example, your ancestry could be “goblin-orc,” or just “goblin” (with orc in their lineage), or a name you choose, like “toothling.”

### **Step 2: Choose Ancestry Features**

Work with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries in your character’s lineage.

You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with your other cards or next to your character sheet. For example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the “Surefooted” and “Tusks” features or the “Sturdy” and “Danger Sense” features. You can’t take both the “Surefooted” and “Sturdy” features.

If your character's heritage includes more than two ancestries, you only choose features from two. You can represent additional ancestries through their appearance or backstory.
